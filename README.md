# flappybirdses
Inspired by https://twitter.com/mcclure111/status/625348312472748033, this is my attempt to make 28 flappy birdses. In as many different languages as possible, just to make things interesting.

## Games
Well, they're going to be flappybirdses.
Since I can't think of 28 different languages for now, I'm planning to do a second variation of Flappy Bird for some of the languages/frameworks to get to 28.
What the second variation will look like specifically, I'm not sure yet.

## Languages

1. C
  * [betray](http://quelsolaar.com/technology/betray.html), [seduce](http://quelsolaar.com/technology/seduce.html) and [persuade](http://quelsolaar.com/technology/persuade.html) all seem interesting, let's see if I can use them to make a C-based Flappy Bird. Worst case, I only use betray and wing it.
2. C++
  * OpenGL: use some sort of OpenGL-based renderer (maybe OGRE? but maybe that's overkill)
  * SDL: Use SDL for a 2D-rendered version
3. C#
  * Unity: Can't go building games without unity nowadays, can I?
  * .NET: Use the animations offered by WPF/WinRT
4. Python: [PyGame](http://www.pygame.org/), [Kivy](http://kivy.org/), [Cocos2d](http://cocos2d.org/)? Choices, choices...
5. Lua: [LÃ–VE](https://love2d.org/) looks like it's made for this
6. JavaScript (or some dialect: [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) or [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/) should be fun)
7. Assembler (probably 6502): Should be possible to repurpose the "physics engine" from Nodhigg (to be released) for a Flappy Bird.
8. Java: AWT should be enough
9. Clojure: [play-clj](https://github.com/oakes/play-clj)?
10. Scala: [scage](https://github.com/dunnololda/scage) looks pretty
11. Haxe: [HaxePunk](http://haxepunk.com/) or [HaxeFlixel](http://haxeflixel.com/) are the obvious choices here. I like HaxePunk's developer console, but HaxeFlixel seemed significantly more mature last time I checked.
12. Ruby: [Gosu](https://www.libgosu.org/), I guess?
13. Rust: [Piston](http://www.piston.rs/)!
14. Go
15. [Twine](http://twinery.org/): The resulting game will most likely not be nearly as good as [The Pipes Are My Solitude](http://www.philome.la/VideoJames_/the-pipes-are-my-solitude/play)
